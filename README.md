## ALX Listing App.
<p>This project involves building an Airbnb clone, a web application that allows users to list, search, and book accommodations. The app replicates core Airbnb features such as user authentication, property listings, booking management, and reviews. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, including frontend, backend, and database integration.</p>

### Folder Structure

- **components/**  
    Contains reusable React components such as buttons, forms, modals, and listing cards. Each component is typically organized in its own folder with related styles and tests.

- **constants/**  
    Stores static values and configuration data used throughout the app, such as API endpoints, route names, and enumerations.

- **interfaces/**  
    Defines TypeScript interfaces and types for data models (e.g., User, Listing, Booking), ensuring type safety and consistency across the codebase.

- **public/assets/**  
    Holds static files like images, icons, and fonts that are publicly accessible. These assets are used for branding, UI elements, and content display.

This structure helps maintain code organization, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
